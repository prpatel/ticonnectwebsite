If you have been developing javascript applications, you can use the following familiar tools: nodejs, express, mongo, yeoman (with bootstrap generators as well as support for LESS), and your favorite templating engine - handlebars, jade, mustache.

          <span class="speaker-session-desc">
            With Node.js came the dream of writing a single codebase and having it run on the client as well as the server. Now, a number of tools and libraries are helping us make this a reality. Soon, it will be the preferred way to build for the web. In this talk, we will look at tools and techniques for building Isomorphic JavaScript apps and discuss the reasons why you may want to do this for your next website or application. We'll walk through an application built with React and Browserify. In addition, we'll examine how this style of web development works with the design process.

            Firefox OS is an open source operating system for mobile phones designed entirely around HTML5, Javascript, CSS and open web standards. By leveraging the inherent advantages of web development and giving developers access to hardware through web standards, we can make an open and affordable mobile web a reality. In this talk Jason Weathersby from Mozilla will show how Firefox OS works, how to build and debug apps for it, and how end users will benefit from this open alternative to other platforms.

Machine learning helps power everything from Google Now to the lowly OS X Preview app — but you don't have to be a Prolog or eCommerce geek to harness its power! In this session, software developer and instructor Jonathan Martin of Big Nerd Ranch, will give you a whirlwind tour of the fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning, then explore a front-end application: selecting the "best" photos to feature on our photo sharing site. Don't expect mathematically laborious derivations of SVM kernels or the infinite VC dimension of Neural Nets, but we will gain enough intuition to make informed compromises (thanks to the No Free Lunch theorem, everything is a compromise) in our pursuit of aesthetically-intelligent machines.

We will discuss some of the terminology that Angular offers, and see how we can use that to develop highly interactive, dynamic web applications. Angular embraces HTML and CSS, allowing you to extend HTML towards your application, and uses plain JavaScript which makes your code easy to reuse, and test. This is an intro level talk. It is targeted towards developers who are curious about Angular and want to learn about the fundamental features and concepts in Angular.

(R)OOTS - Roots is a light, super fast, and intuitive static build system made for front end development and building web apps. Think grunt without the config, think yeoman with no config. It is an open ended tool to make coding fast and deployment even faster. It allows you to write in the language(s) of your preference. From coffeescript to dogescript. From haml to jade. (M)ARIONETTE.JS - Marionette is the view glue upon which parse and backbone sit. It provides a (semi) opinionated framework upon which to build your app. Taking the best™ practices of standard backbone view handling and abstracting them into ItemView and CollectionView concepts.

            Adding a WebSocket service to an application is often misunderstood to be high performance by default, however there are many more considerations that must be made, both on the client and server, before the best performance can be achieved. Real-time technologies like SPDY, WebSocket, and soon HTTP 2.0 have their own sets of hurdles and anti-patterns to overcome and this talk will provide the checklist you need to fine tune your application’s real-time performance. We’ll review the following in detail: Using secure WebSocket (WSS) opposed to unsecure (WS), Polyfill performance, WS subprotocols and different styles of interacting with WebSocket services, Binary transmissions and optimizations, Compression, and Battery life and optimizing long lived sessions.

  CODE OF CONDUCT
  ==========================================================================
  -->

  <div id="codeOfConduct" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal>
    <p><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></p>
    <p>Connect.js is dedicated to providing an outstanding conference experience for all attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers and organizers (Connect.js participants) regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, financial status, hair color (or hair amount), platform preference, or text editor of choice. We do not tolerate harassment of Connect.js participants in any form. Please treat your fellow Connect.js participants with respect, regardless of the context you’re interacting with them.</p>

    <p>Harassment is not appropriate for any conference venue… We expect all Connect.js participants to follow the Code of Conduct during the conference. This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations, and in related online communities and social media. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct may be expelled from the conference without a refund, and/or banned from future Connect.js events, at the discretion of Connect.js</p>

    <p>Examples of harassment include offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, sexualized images in public spaces, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of sessions or events, and unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention. Speaker presentations fall under this category and should not use images or examples that would violate the code of conduct.</p>

    <p>Connect.js participants must remember that Connect.js organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement. Connect.js organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to Cobb Galleria staff or law enforcement.</p>

    <p>For the protection of Connect.js participants, Connect.js will never put its organizers or volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits escalation. If there is any doubt, we will escalate incidents to the appropriate agency immediately.</p>

    <p>Incident Resolution</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All Connect.js participants agree to treat each other with respect, regardless of whether you are in a session room or at  the Cobb Galleria facilities.</li>
      <li>Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals concerned.</li>
      <li>Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a Connect.js organizer or volunteer. That person will immediately contact a Connect.js Board member who has the responsibility to assist in resolution.</li>
      <li>Connect.js participants suffering outright assault or extreme harassment should contact the Cobb Galleria staff immediately, or a Connect.js organizer if they're nearby. That person will immediately escalate the issue to the Cobb Galleria staff or law enforcement as appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
